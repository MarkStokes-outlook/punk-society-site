            <h2>Why this exists</h2>
            <p>
              Public and private services routinely fail neurodivergent people, not because screens
              are unreadable but because the <strong>cognitive contract</strong> is incomplete.
              Systems assume unlimited executive function, flawless memory, and tolerance for
              punishment when deadlines are missed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re here to measure that failure, teach better patterns, and surface the
              organisations that treat neurodivergent users with respect.
            </p>

            <h3>Mission statement</h3>
            <blockquote>
              Make cognitive accessibility measurable, transparent, and irresistible to adopt.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              We combine human narrative, structured scoring, and actionable guidance so ND users
              can trust the services they rely on—and so builders can see exactly where to improve.

            <h2>Movement &amp; framework</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Punk Society</strong> is the cultural engine. It tells the stories, maps
              cognitive friction, and keeps the mission human. Think patch notes for culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cognify</strong> is the standards body. It defines the Cognitive Friction
              Index, publishes audits, and certifies ND-friendly services so society ships with
              compatibility mode turned on by default.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both halves feed each other: the movement drives demand; the framework delivers proof.
              We call out friction so the world can upgrade itself before we ever name and shame.

            <h3>Accountability &amp; promise</h3>
            <p>
              Society isn’t broken; it’s just running the base install. Our job is to ship the
              upgrade with enough guidance that everyone can install it. We start by sharing
              anonymous stories and practical fixes. Once Cognify standards are established and
              organisations have had a fair chance to learn, we’ll hold the stubborn ones publicly
              accountable.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will roast bad systems with humour, but we fix them with compassion. Kindness,
              clarity, and recovery patterns are measurable—and they change lives when designers
              listen.
