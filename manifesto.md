# Neurodivergent Accessibility Manifesto

## Why This Exists
Public and private services routinely fail neurodivergent people, not because the screens are unreadable but because the **cognitive contract** is broken. Systems assume unlimited executive function, flawless memory, and tolerance for punishment when deadlines are missed. This project exists to measure that failure, teach better patterns, and surface the organisations that treat neurodivergent users with respect.

## Mission Statement
> Make cognitive accessibility measurable, transparent, and irresistible to adopt.

We combine human narrative, structured scoring, and actionable guidance so ND users can trust the services they rely on—and so builders can see exactly where to improve.

## Movement & Framework
- **Punk Society** — the cultural engine. It tells the stories, maps cognitive friction, and keeps the mission human.
- **Cognify** — the standards body. It defines the Cognitive Friction Index, publishes audits, and certifies ND-friendly services.

Both halves feed each other: the movement drives demand; the framework delivers proof. We call out friction so the world can upgrade itself before we ever name and shame.

## Design Principles
1. **ND-led by default.** Lived experience steers research, audits, and certification.
2. **Truth over theatre.** Findings are evidence-backed, reproducible, and cited.
3. **Human plus automation.** People spot tone and stress; scripts flag consistency gaps. Both matter.
4. **Grace before blame.** We anonymise stories and invite organisations to learn before we ever call them out by name.
5. **Transparency first.** Scoring math, audit methods, and conflicts of interest stay public.
6. **Do no harm.** Stories are anonymised, consented, and handled with care.
7. **Iteration forever.** The framework evolves as ND testers and clients surface new patterns.

## Change We Want
- ND-friendly scorecards become table stakes for healthcare, finance, energy, and government portals.
- Procurement teams demand cognitive accessibility evidence alongside WCAG reports.
- ND testers get paid, respected work improving systems their communities rely on.
- Reusable heuristics, scripts, and templates make audits fast without dumbing them down.
- Policy makers and watchdogs cite our data to push for kinder public services.

## Operating Modes
| Mode | Description | Outputs |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Public Watchdog** | Crowd-sourced stories and lightweight audits that expose friction hotspots. | Story backlogs, heatmaps, public dashboards. |
| **Consulting Network** | Paid ND-led audits for organisations that want deeper change. | Detailed reports, workshops, certification readiness reviews. |
| **Hybrid** | Community data informs pro audits; pro audits fund community tooling. | Sustainable loop between visibility and remediation. |

## Immediate Goals
- Build a library of first-hand ND stories covering at least 10 common service types.
- Define the Cognitive Friction Index (CFI) rubric plus supporting empathy and recovery metrics.
- Deliver 3 pilot audits (healthcare, government, finance) to prove the workflow.
- Publish a transparent playbook so collaborators can run audits without guesswork.

## North Star Metrics
- Number of services completing full ND audit + remediation plan.
- Average improvement in CFI between first and second audit.
- Volume and diversity of ND testers participating with positive feedback.
- Organisations adopting ND scorecards in procurement or policy documents.

## Accountability & Promise
Society isn’t broken; it’s just running the base install. Our job is to ship the upgrade with enough guidance that everyone can install it. We start by sharing anonymous stories and practical fixes. Once Cognify standards are established and organisations have had a fair chance to learn, we’ll hold the stubborn ones publicly accountable.

We will roast bad systems with humour, but we fix them with compassion. The audit network exists to prove that kindness, clarity, and recovery patterns are measurable—and that they change lives when designers listen.
