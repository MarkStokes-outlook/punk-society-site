            <p>
              Public and private services still assume perfect memory, unlimited
              focus, and zero emotion. That fantasy breaks the cognitive contract
              for neurodivergent people. We make that gap visible, offer the upgrade,
              and give teams the playbooks to install it.

            <h2>The movement + the framework</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Punk Society</strong> is the spotlight. It tells the stories,
              maps the friction, and rallies people to demand neurodivergent-friendly services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cognify</strong> is the standards spine. It defines the Cognitive
              Friction Index (CFI), publishes audits, and certifies services that
              genuinely work for ND communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together they form a closed loop: culture fuels demand, standards deliver proof.

            <h3>Immediate goals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Build a public library of ND stories spanning 10+ sectors.</li>
              <li>Run pilot audits in healthcare, government, and finance.</li>
              <li>Publish the Cognify scoring playbook so allies can replicate it.</li>

            <p>
              Society isn’t broken; it’s just running the base install. We anonymise early stories,
              teach better patterns, and invite organisations to learn before they ever see their
              names in public reports.

              <li>Stories stay anonymous until Cognify publishes the standards and remediation paths.</li>
              <li>Teams get practical guidance first, public accountability later.</li>
