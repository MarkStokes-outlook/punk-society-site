          Punk Society is the cultural front of the Cognitive Revolution. We collect
          neurodivergent stories, roast hostile systems, and fuel the Cognify
          audit network so kinder services become irresistible to adopt.

            <h2>Why we exist</h2>
            <p>
              Public and private services still assume perfect memory, unlimited
              focus, and zero emotion. That fantasy breaks the cognitive contract
              for neurodivergent people. We make that failure measurable, public,
              and fixable.

              <li>We are not broken. Systems are shipping with missing DLC.</li>
              <li>Executive dysfunction is not negligence.</li>

            <h2>The movement + the framework</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Punk Society</strong> is the spotlight. It tells the stories,
              runs campaigns like <em>Install the DLC</em>, and rallies people to demand
              neurodivergent-friendly services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cognify</strong> is the standards spine. It defines the Cognitive
              Friction Index (CFI), publishes audits, and certifies services that
              genuinely work for ND communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together they form the ND Audit Network: culture + rigour, memes + math.

            <h3>Immediate goals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Build a public library of ND stories spanning 10+ sectors.</li>
              <li>Run pilot audits in healthcare, government, and finance.</li>
              <li>Publish the Cognify scoring playbook so allies can replicate it.</li>
              <li>Fund ND testers, creatives, and organisers doing the real work.</li>

              <h3>ND-led by default</h3>
              <p>
                Lived experience steers audits, research, and certification. ND contributors
                are paid, credited, and empowered to call out hostile patterns.

              <h3>Truth over theatre</h3>
              <p>
                Every claim ships with receipts: reproducible steps, recordings, or scripts.
                If the evidence isn’t public, the work isn’t finished.

              <h3>Graceful recovery</h3>
              <p>
                Systems must forgive missed deadlines, timeouts, and brain fog. We grade on how
                well you help people back on track, not how harshly you punish them.

              <h3>Transparency first</h3>
              <p>
                Scoring maths, audit methods, and conflicts of interest stay in the open so
                nothing turns into corporate hand-waving.

              The Cognitive Friction Index starts with human experience. We are building an
              anonymous intake form, but you can start feeding the backlog today via GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              Share the service, what went wrong, how it impacted you, and whether we can
              publish the anonymised version. We’ll route it into the ND Audit Network,
              prioritise sectors with the most pain, and keep you posted as audits begin.
