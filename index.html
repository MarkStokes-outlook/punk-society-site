            <p>
              Most systems assume you have perfect memory, unlimited executive function,
              the ability to call places during business hours, and the mental bandwidth to
              navigate 12-step processes without melting down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cool. Except 15-20% of people don't work that way.

            <p>
              Energy companies make switching tariffs so complicated that people with ADHD stay
              on expensive rates for years. Subscription services hide the cancel button because
              they know you'll forget to find it. Online forms time out if you need thinking time.
            </p>

            <h2>What we're actually doing</h2>
            <p>
              We collect stories from neurodivergent people about where systems break.
              Then we show companies how to fix them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not with guilt. Not with public shaming. With specific, practical changes
              that make life easier for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of "be more accessible," we say: Let people
              book appointments online. Send confirmation texts automatically. Allow reschedules
              without calling. Don't make people repeat themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small changes for most people. Essential changes for us.

              Most ND advocacy says "understand us better." We say <strong>build better systems.</strong>

            <p>
              We're not asking for sympathy. We're asking for online booking instead of phone-only.
              Text confirmations instead of "remember this." One contact person instead of explaining
              three times. Clear cancellation instead of dark patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              These help everyone. They're essential for us.

              GP portals that time out mid-booking. Benefits forms that require 19 pieces of

              These aren't random failures. They're design choices that assume everyone has

              Every time a system breaks for you, that's data. Every missed appointment because
              you had to call at 8am. Every expensive tariff you're stuck on because switching is
              too complicated. Every subscription you can't cancel because the button is hidden.

              Every movement needs a blueprint. Ours lays out exactly what we're fighting for,
              how we measure success, and why cognitive accessibility isn't a nice-to-have —
              <strong>it's a human right.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Use it to brief your team. Share it with policy makers. Send it to services that
              failed you. Make them understand that we're not asking anymore — we're demanding.
