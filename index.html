        <p class="lede">
          We were taught to smile, speak "professionally," and absorb the fines, suspensions, and
          humiliating phone calls when we inevitably forget. That mask costs sleep, rent, sanity.
          <strong>All because systems punish the way our brains actually work.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lede">
          This is the rally point. We drag the receipts, torch the fake niceness, and demand

            <p>
              Every system in society was designed for brains that remember appointments,
              process 47-step forms without melting down, and can "just call" someone without
              three days of dread. <strong>That's not most of us.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We lose jobs because we can't sit still. We lose homes because paperwork has
              19 steps and a 48-hour deadline. We're told to "try harder" when our brains
              are already running on fumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Enough.</strong> We're not asking for special treatment. We're demanding
              that society stop punishing us for being wired differently.

              <strong>Punk Society</strong> is the noise. We collect your stories, amplify

            </p>

              <strong>Cognify</strong> is the proof. We audit services, score their cognitive
              accessibility, and publish the results. No more corporate hand-waving about
              "inclusive design" — we measure it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together: <strong>We make the case. We force the change. We hold them accountable.</strong>

              Every movement needs a blueprint. Ours lays out exactly what we're fighting for,
              how we measure success, and why cognitive accessibility isn't a nice-to-have —
              <strong>it's a human right.</strong>

            <p>
              Use it to brief your team. Share it with policy makers. Send it to services that
              failed you. Make them understand that we're not asking anymore — we're demanding.
